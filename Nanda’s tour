Q.
Nanda decides to go to a tour. So he himself prepared a map and he started from the city where he lives in, determine the lengths of the shortest paths from the starting city to all other cities in the map. If a city is unreachable, its distance is -1. Cities will be numbered consecutively as from and to, and edges will have varying distances or lengths.
 Sample-Input: 
Enter no. of cities:5  
Enter the cost matrix:
 0 3 4 0 0
 3 0 5 6 2
 4 5 0 0 0 
0 6 0 0 0
 0 2 0 0 0
 Enter the starting city:3
 Sample-Output: 
Distance of node0=9 
Path=0<-1<-3 
Distance of node1=6 
Path=1<-3 
Distance of node2=11 
Path=2<-1<-3 
Distance of node4=8 
Path=4<-1<-3
