Q.
Probability of reaching a point with 2 or 3 steps at a time 
A person starts walking from position X = 0, find the probability to reach exactly on X = N if she  can only take either 2 steps or 3 steps. Probability for step length 2 is given i.e. P, probability for  step length 3 is 1 â€“ P. 
Examples : 
Input : N = 5, P = 0.20 
Output : 0.32 
Explanation :- 
There are two ways to reach 5. 
2+3 with probability = 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16 
3+2 with probability = 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.16 
So, total probability = 0.32.

def find_prob(N, P) : 
    dp =[0] * (n + 1) 
    dp[0] = 1 
    dp[1] = 0 
    dp[2] = P 
    dp[3] = 1 - P 
    for i in range(4, N + 1) : 
        dp[i] = (P) * dp[i - 2] + (1 - P) * dp[i - 3] 
    return dp[N] 
n = int(input()) 
p = float(input()) 
print(round(find_prob(n, p), 2))

INPUT:
N=5
P=0.20
OUTPUT:
0.32
